# General Knowledge Quiz

## Quick Description
This is a quiz in which the user will answer ten general knowledge questions and will see their result at the end of it. This idea came to me when i was looking at challenges to improve my Javascript.

 ## Resources Used
 + HTML
 + CSS
 + JavaScript 

 ## The Steps Taken

 Building the quiz has helped me tremendously further my Javascript skills, but most importantly, it's helped me understand the planning involved to build an effective application. Here are the steps i took to bring this project to life.

 1. **Defining The App's Purpose** - I started by clarifying what the quiz should achieve. My goal was for the user to answer a series of questions and see their score at the end. Knowing this helped me focus on the core features the app needed. 

 2. **Structuring the Layout in HTML** - I creating ID's such as questions, answers, results and score, planning to use these in Javascript to edit the content shown in respect to the flow of the quiz. The instruction box on the left of the quiz is to help user's understand the premise of the game. 

 3. **Styling with CSS** - I created a cohesive color scheme to apply to elements in the styling. I also added hover and active effects to buttons to make they more interactive.

 4. **Adding Functionality** - This was both the most challenging and rewarding part of the project. As a beginner, I approached this by breaking down the functionality into smaller, manageable tasks.

For example, I began with the "Start Quiz" button, which was initially the only interactive element on the page. I considered what should happen when the button was clicked, determining that it would initiate a startQuiz() function to kick off the quiz. From there, I followed a similar process to design each subsequent step, ensuring each function seamlessly guided users through the quiz experience.

The scoring system was added in later once i was confident that the quiz was working how i wanted it to.

 5. **Testing and Refining** -  Finally, I tested the quiz to ensure it worked smoothly. During this phase, I noticed areas for improvement, such as making the app responsive and adding a restart button. Iterating on these details enhanced the appâ€™s usability.

## Key Takeaways

+ **Planning and Structure:** Breaking down the project into specific tasks helped me stay organized and made debugging easier.
+ **User Experience:** Thinking from the user's perspective guided my decisions, like adding feedback for correct or incorrect answers, showing scores, and including a restart button.
+ **Responsive Design:** I learned the importance of making apps accessible on different devices, which led me to optimize the quiz for mobile viewing.
